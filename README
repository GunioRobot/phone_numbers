HasPhoneNumber
==============

HasPhoneNumber makes validations for US phone numbers in ActiveRecord models easy.
Just make sure your model has a string attribute to store your phone number, and
then pass it on to has_phone_number.

  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_phone_number :cell_phone
  end
  
You're done! This will ensure that the phone number in cell_phone is of a valid US
phone number format, and invalidate Person if the phone number is invalid. Oh, it
will also play nice with form_for, so you can display the errors to your users.

Hope you like it!
